# Dataset
`Fashion-MNIST` is a dataset of [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/)'s article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend `Fashion-MNIST` to serve as a direct **drop-in replacement** for the original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

Here's an example how the data looks (*each class takes three-rows*):

# Models & performance

Final average accuracy on test dataset: 94.22% (over 5 repetitions)
This has been obtained by training for 100 epochs and saving the models with lowest validation losses.

I also tried an ensemble of these models, which yielded 94.86% accuracy.
